      <h3>Smart lamp for blind people</h3>
      <img class="photo" src="project1.jpg" alt="Smart HR Monitor">
      <p>
        The Smart Lamp for Blind People is an assistive technology project designed to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals. This intelligent lamp integrates sensors and voice feedback to provide environmental awareness and illumination. It automatically detects human presence using PIR sensors and turns on the light, helping users navigate in dark rooms. Additionally, the lamp includes an obstacle detection system using ultrasonic sensors, which alerts users through audio prompts to avoid collisions. The device is powered by a microcontroller, with voice output enabled via a speaker or Bluetooth-connected audio device. The project focuses on affordability, ease of use, and improving daily life for blind users by merging lighting control with smart navigation assistance. This innovation demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems and IoT in solving real-world accessibility challenges.
